This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=TRUE}
crime<-read.csv("C:/Users/Nathan/Dropbox/Big Data/Leada/CrimeData/Crime_SanFrancisco/SFPD_Incidents.csv")
str(crime)
summary(crime)
names(crime)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(crime$Category)
describe(crime$Category)
hist(crime$Category)
View(crime)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
